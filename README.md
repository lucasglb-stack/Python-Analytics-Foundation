# Python for Data Analysis: Learning Journey 🚀

This repository serves as a structured log of my transition into the Data Science and Analytics field. As a professional with a background in Electrical Engineering and a PhD in Economics, my goal is to bridge the gap between complex financial modeling and scalable Python-driven solutions.

## 📌 Objective
Documenting the evolution of my technical skills, starting from Python fundamentals to advanced data manipulation, focused on applications for the energy sector and financial controlling.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The scripts are organized by topic to reflect the curriculum followed at Asimov Academy and other specialized tracks:

* **01_Fundamentals/**
    * `slicing_and_ranges.py`: Mastering sequence manipulation and indexing.
    * `list_comprehension_basics.py`: (Coming soon) Writing idiomatic and efficient Python.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Focus:** Data Structures, SQL Integration, and Financial Automation.
* **Tools:** Git, VS Code.

## 📈 Future Milestones
- [ ] Integration with SQL databases for financial reporting.
- [ ] Data cleaning and exploration using Pandas.
- [ ] Developing automated tax calculation scripts for the energy market.
